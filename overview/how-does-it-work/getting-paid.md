# ðŸ’¸ Getting paid

Both the payer (principal amount) payee (interest amount) and fee receiver (fee amount) will receive their funds on the due date of the payment.&#x20;

The payout function gets called automatically twice a day, thanks to [Gelato's Web3 Functions](https://www.gelato.network/blog/web3-functions-serverless-apps).

The protocol charges a 10% fee on the interest amount. These fees are used to cover expenses. The fee % is subject to change.
