# âœ¨ How does it work?

This part of the documentation is aimed towards regular users that use the Paytr frontend. Paytr is currently in beta. The frontend will be launched in May.

Our frontend has a Faucet button you can use to acquire some test USDC. Make sure to grab some test MATIC before you start using the app.

while in beta, the Paytr protocol only supports USDC on Polygon Mumbai.
