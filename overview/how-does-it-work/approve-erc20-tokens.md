# üëç Approve ERC20 tokens

### Approving the Paytr smart contract and initiating a payment

One of the prerequisites of making a payment is approving the usage of the ERC20 token you'd like to use.\

#### Approve ERC20 tokens using the Paytr app

The Paytr frontend automatically checks the approved amount (aka 'allowance') per ERC20 token for the connected account. Should you want to make a payment without sufficient allowance, the app will ask you to increase the allowance first.
