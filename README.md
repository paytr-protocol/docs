## Overview

The Paytr Protocol aims to facilitate compounding interests by paying invoices early, or locking funds on different platforms like escrow services and crowdfunding websites. Pay early and earn!

You can access our app on [https://paytr.netlify.app](https://paytr.netlify.app/). Developers can integrate our protocol by calling the smart contract directly.
