# The Paytr Protocol: Earn money by paying early

Get rewarded just by paying. Easy, right? No need to do anything out of the ordinary.
You pay, our smart contract takes care of the yield, you and your supplier receive funds on the due date.
And there are more perks if you pay early:

* Discounts
* Perfect payer reputation
* No penalties or fees because of late payments
* Stronger relationships
* Improved terms
* Reduced stress
* Priority service

Early payments offer savings, trust and long-term advantages. And with more and more platforms using onchain signals to let you borrow, Paytr is the perfect protocol to use for all your payments.
 
Are you making direct payments or offering a crypto invoicing solution? Get in touch! Weâ€™d love for you to use our protocol so everyone can benefit.
 
Our smart contract leverages the power of [Compound Finance](https://compound.finance/) to earn yield on your payments.

## More use cases:
 
* Risk free invoice factoring when payment was made through Paytr. The payout date is confirmed.
* Easy incoming cash flow planning
